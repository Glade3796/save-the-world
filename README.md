<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src='src/assets/Screenshot 2024-01-12 at 11.46.45.png' />

The game is based on the classic cookie clicker concept. At the top is a ticker bar which shows how much carbon is required to be sequestered each year in order to avoid catastrophic cimlate failure. It also displays the funds you have available to spend on various assets to help in your efforts.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

You will land on a splash screen. Simply click resume game to begin. <br/>

You can visit this menu any time by clicking th menu button.<br/>

You also have an info page to easily view your current gamestate, as well as access to this readme and more information on climate change.<br/>

### Playing the game

The carbon target will continuosly increase. As will your funds.<br/>

Beneath the ticker bar is a series of three buttons.<br/>

<b>Plant trees</b> - Each tree instanty sequesters some carbon and adds to the sequester rate, you'll also gain a little cash thanks to some government insentives. <br/>

<b>Plant forest</b> - This button can be clicked every 2 seconds, it costs a little money but is 10x more effective than planting trees one at a time.<br/>

<b>Community rewilding</b> - Get the community involved and rewild those parking lots. You can press this button every 5 seconds, it costs a little bit more but will help sequester a lot of carbon. <br/>



### Purchase area

Beneath the clicker buttons are various assets available for you to purchase. Slide the bar to increase the amount purchased<br/>

<b>Solar panel</b> - Costing £1000 and causing some carbon to be emitted. Solar panels will reduce the amount of total carbon emitted by a small amount <br/>

<b>Electric public vehicles</b> - Costing £5,000 and causing carbon to be emitted. EPV's will reduce the amount of total carbon emitted by a medium amount <br/>

<b>Invest in Environment</b> - Investing in the environment will help to increase your funds and increase amount of carbon sequestered. <br/>

<b>Invest in renewables</b> - Invest £100,000 into renewable energy souces. This will cause a spike of emissions but will earn you more income AND help lower the amount of carbon emitted each year.<br/>
